# Personal Wallet

The personal wallet is a smart contract developed to accept certain allowed tokens. These selected tokens will be the tokens from our business partners and other projects. Only a select few will be accepted on our platform.

These selected tokens will be specified in the ReceivableTokens.sol smart contract. 

This is the basic draft of the personal wallet smart contract to be used on platform and is implementing the ERC223 standard.
